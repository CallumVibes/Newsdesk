# Newsdesk

A clean news app for the Fire TV Stick and for Android phones. No clutter, just news.

One build, two layouts. On a TV it's headlines on the left, a large preview on the right, and a full-screen reader, all driven by the D-pad. On a phone it's a single column of headlines you tap to read. The app works out which one it is when it starts.

## Sources

| Source | How it's read |
| --- | --- |
| Citadel Wire | Nostr notes from `npub1q8g803ajr0lw3xngs0k6hn2q3mejf6dtgv05d06h6krqgv9uh97q5382kp`, with the site's RSS feeds as backup. Each wire is split into its individual stories. |
| Kagi News | RSS per category: UK, World, Technology, Science and Bitcoin. UK stories are given priority. Summaries are licensed CC BY-NC. |
| Vegan Food & Living | The site's news feed, with its WordPress API and any feed advertised on the homepage as backup. |
| Leominster events | What's on in town, from the `council_events` listing. Tried as the WordPress API, then the listing's feed, then the listing page itself. |

## Tabs

- **Breaking news** — everything from the last 3 hours, newest first. A red dot marks unseen stories.
- **Today** — an optional AI briefing, then the day's biggest stories, local news, vegan food and living, what's on in town, and Bitcoin and markets.
- **All** — everything, taking turns between sources so none of them floods the list.

## Remote (Fire TV)

| Button | Does |
| --- | --- |
| ◀ ▶ | Switch tab, or move between stories in the reader |
| ▲ ▼ | Move through headlines, or scroll |
| OK | Read a story |
| ☰ Menu | Sources panel: what loaded, from where, and any errors. OK refreshes. |
| Back | Top of list, then Today, then exit |

After 3 idle minutes it shows one story at a time, dimmed and drifting to protect the screen. Any button wakes it.

## Touch (phone and tablet)

| Gesture | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Tap a tab | Switch tab |
| Swipe left or right | Switch tab, or move between stories in the reader |
| Tap a headline | Read the story |
| Scroll | Normal scrolling throughout |
| ☰ (top right) | Sources panel: what loaded, from where, and any errors |
| Back | Top of list, then Today, then exit |

The phone keeps its status bar, rotates freely and is left to sleep on its own, so there's no idle screen and nothing holds the display awake.

## Build

The whole project is embedded in `.github/workflows/build-newsdesk.yml`, so that one file is all the repo needs. No laptop required.

1. Push the workflow file, or run it from the **Actions** tab.
2. Download the `newsdesk-apk-<run>` artifact.
3. Install it:

```
adb install -r newsdesk-<run>.apk
```

It's signed with a fixed key, so each build installs over the last one.

## AI briefing (optional)

Add a repository secret named `PPQ_API_KEY` with a [PPQ.ai](https://ppq.ai) key and rebuild. The app then writes a short briefing each morning from that day's stories, rewriting it at most every 3 hours and never more than 6 times a day.

Optionally add a repository variable `PPQ_MODEL` to pick a model. The default is `claude-sonnet-4-5`.

**Keep this repo private.** The key is built into the APK.

## Settings

Near the top of `app/src/main/assets/index.html`:

| Setting | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `HOME_TAB` | Which tab opens first |
| `BREAKING_HOURS` | How new a story must be to count as breaking |
| `BREAKING_PER_SOURCE` | Most stories one source may put on **Breaking news** |
| `KAGI_WANT` | Which Kagi categories to pull |
| `KAGI_BOOST` | How much of a head start UK stories get |
| `EVENT_WINDOW_DAYS` | How far ahead **On in town** looks before falling back to the soonest events |
| `EVENTS_SHOWN` | How many events sit in Today |
| `CW_RELAYS` | Which Nostr relays to ask |
| `IDLE_AFTER_MS` | How long before the idle screen starts |

## Events

**On in town** is a diary, not a news feed, so it behaves differently from every other source:

- It sorts forwards. The next thing on is at the top, and anything already over drops to the bottom.
- It never appears under **Breaking news**, and a future date can't masquerade as a story that just broke.
- Rows read "Tomorrow, 16:30" rather than "2h ago". An event whose date can't be read shows no time at all rather than the day it was posted.

The date comes from the listing's own field where it has one, and is otherwise read out of the title or the blurb ("5 September 2026", "12th June at 4:30pm"). The AI briefing is told these are upcoming events rather than news, and is given the date.

## Requirements

Fire OS 5 or newer, or an Android 5.1+ phone or tablet. One APK covers both. Built with Gradle 8.9, Java 17 and AGP 8.5.
